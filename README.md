# BDK Flutter Workshop

This is a workshop to learn how to build an on-chain Bitcoin wallet app using the [Bitcoin Development Kit](https://bitcoindevkit.org) (BDK) in Flutter by making use of the [bdk_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/bdk_flutter) package developed by [Let there be Lightning](https://ltbl.io).

## Audience

This workshop is targeted at software developers.
Mobile developers and especially Flutter developers will benefit the most from this workshop, but anyone with a basic understanding of programming and a willingness to learn can participate.

Although mobile and especially Flutter developers will benefit the most from this workshop, experience with mobile development is **NOT** required.
Also knowledge about Bitcoin itself is helpful, but **NOT** required.

We think the workshop can be fun and a great learning experience for both developers that want to learn about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as Bitcoin and Lightning developers that want to learn about mobile development.

## Goal

The main goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) and the `bdk_flutter` package and get you familiar with its capabilities, APIs and the basic concepts of building a Bitcoin wallet app in Flutter.

## ⚠️ To do before the workshop

Follow the instructions in the [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) file to install the required software to be able to participate in the workshop.
