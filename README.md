# BDK Flutter Workshop

This is a workshop to learn how to build an on-chain Bitcoin wallet app using the [Bitcoin Development Kit](https://bitcoindevkit.org) (BDK) in Flutter by making use of the [bdk_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/bdk_flutter) package developed by [Let there be Lightning](https://ltbl.io).

## Audience

This workshop is targeted at software developers.
Mobile developers and especially Flutter developers will benefit the most from this workshop, but anyone with a basic understanding of programming and a willingness to learn can participate.

Although mobile and especially Flutter developers will benefit the most from this workshop, experience with mobile development is **NOT** required.
Also knowledge about Bitcoin itself is helpful, but **NOT** required.

We think the workshop can be fun and a great learning experience for both developers that want to learn about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as Bitcoin and Lightning developers that want to learn about mobile development.

## Goal

The main goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) and the `bdk_flutter` package and get you familiar with its capabilities, APIs and the basic concepts of building a Bitcoin wallet app in Flutter.

## ⚠️ To do before the workshop

Follow the instructions in the [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) file to install the required software to be able to participate in the workshop.

## Workshop Dynamics

The workshop can be given by an instructor showing the code and explaining the concepts, while the participants follow along and implement the code themselves.
It can also be given as a self-paced workshop where the participants follow the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) in this repository and implement the code themselves while the instructor is available for questions and to make sure everyone gets through the workshop.
It can also be a mix of both, or be done completely self-paced without an instructor by just following the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) and looking at the [solutions](SOLUTIONS.md) to compare or when stuck.
