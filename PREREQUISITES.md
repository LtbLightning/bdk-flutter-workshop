# Prerequisites

This workshop is an hands-on workshop for software developers. To be able to participate, you need to bring your own laptop with some [Software and Tools](#software-and-tools) installed on it already.

There will not be any time to do this during the workshop, so please make sure to have everything installed and ready to go before the workshop starts.

On average it takes about 60 to 90 minutes to install everything, so please plan accordingly.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please reach out through the workshop's communication channels as soon as possible.
